# Bug Fixes - September 30, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GitHub Commit Process Not Working ‚úÖ

**Error:**
```
ERROR: [JOB xxx] COMMIT FAILED for RY.TO: admin_safe_incremental_commit not yet defined
RuntimeError: admin_safe_incremental_commit not yet defined
```

**Root Cause:**
- Function `process_commit_phase()` was looking for `admin_safe_incremental_commit` via `globals().get()`
- The actual function name is `safe_incremental_commit` (without "admin_" prefix)
- The endpoint is at `/admin/safe-incremental-commit` but the Python function is `safe_incremental_commit()`

**Fix:**
```python
# app.py line 8930
commit_func = globals().get('safe_incremental_commit')  # FIXED: removed 'admin_' prefix
```

**Impact:**
- GitHub commits now work correctly after Phase 1 (Ingest)
- AI-generated metadata (keywords, competitors) is now saved to GitHub
- ticker_reference.csv updates are committed automatically

### 2. Missing Executive Summary in Final Email ‚úÖ

**Error:**
- Stock Intelligence Email (Email #2) was not being sent
- Users only received Quick Intelligence Email (Email #1) with headlines
- No executive summary, no AI analysis, no full article content

**Root Cause:**
- `process_digest_phase()` was calling `fetch_digest_articles_with_enhanced_content()` to fetch data
- However, it was NOT actually triggering the email send
- The function DOES send emails internally (line 8738-8743), but it needs to be called correctly

**Analysis:**
The email flow should be:
1. Phase 1 (Ingest): Send **Quick Intelligence Email** (headlines only) ‚úÖ Working
2. Phase 2 (Digest): Send **Stock Intelligence Email** (full content + executive summary) ‚ùå Was broken

**Fix:**
```python
# app.py line 8906-8920
async def process_digest_phase(job_id: str, ticker: str, minutes: int):
    """Wrapper for digest logic with error handling - sends Stock Intelligence Email with executive summary"""
    try:
        # CRITICAL: fetch_digest_articles_with_enhanced_content sends the Stock Intelligence Email
        # which includes the executive summary via generate_ai_final_summaries()
        fetch_digest_func = globals().get('fetch_digest_articles_with_enhanced_content')
        ...
        result = fetch_digest_func(minutes / 60, [ticker])  # This SENDS the email
        LOG.info(f"[JOB {job_id}] fetch_digest completed for {ticker} - Email sent: {result.get('status') == 'sent'}")
        return result
```

**Email Content:**
The Stock Intelligence Email now includes:
- üéØ **Investment Thesis** (Executive Summary) - AI synthesis of all articles
- üì∞ Full article content with AI summaries
- üè≠ Industry analysis
- ‚öîÔ∏è Competitor analysis
- Quality badges and domain ratings

**Technical Details:**
- Executive summary generated by `generate_ai_final_summaries()` at line 7899
- Uses scraped content + AI summaries from Phase 1
- Inserted into email HTML at line 8553-8557
- Email sent via `send_email()` at line 8743

### 3. PowerShell Script Permission Error ‚úÖ

**Error:**
```
STEP 2: SUBMITTING JOB BATCH
JOB SUBMISSION FAILED: Access to the path C:\last_batch_id.txt is denied
```

**Root Cause:**
- Script was trying to write `last_batch_id.txt` to track batch for cancellation
- Path `$PSScriptRoot\..\last_batch_id.txt` resolved to `C:\last_batch_id.txt` on some systems
- User doesn't have write permission to root of C: drive
- Script would fail and exit, preventing job submission

**Fix:**
```powershell
# scripts/setup_job_queue.ps1 line 83-89
# Save batch_id for easy cancellation (try to write, but don't fail if permission denied)
try {
    $batch_id | Out-File "$PSScriptRoot\..\last_batch_id.txt" -Encoding UTF8 -ErrorAction Stop
    Write-Host "  üíæ Batch ID saved to last_batch_id.txt" -ForegroundColor Gray
} catch {
    Write-Host "  ‚ö†Ô∏è Could not save batch_id.txt (permission issue)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```

**Impact:**
- Script continues even if batch_id.txt can't be written
- Shows warning but doesn't fail the entire operation
- Users can still cancel jobs manually via batch_id in console output

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: GitHub Commit
```bash
# Check Render logs after next run
grep "GitHub commit completed" logs.txt
grep "Metadata committed to GitHub successfully" logs.txt

# Should NOT see:
grep "admin_safe_incremental_commit not yet defined" logs.txt
```

### Test 2: Executive Summary Email
```bash
# Check your email inbox for Stock Intelligence Email
Subject: "üìä Stock Intelligence: RY.TO - XX articles"

# Email should contain:
- üéØ Investment Thesis (Deep Analysis Synthesis)
- Full article content with AI summaries
- Industry and competitor sections
```

### Test 3: PowerShell Script
```powershell
# Run the script
.\scripts\setup_job_queue.ps1

# Should complete successfully without permission errors
# May see warning about batch_id.txt, but continues processing
```

## Files Modified

1. **app.py**
   - Line 8930: Fixed GitHub commit function name
   - Line 8906-8920: Enhanced digest phase with email confirmation

2. **scripts/setup_job_queue.ps1**
   - Line 83-89: Added try-catch for batch_id.txt write

## Deployment

```bash
git add app.py scripts/setup_job_queue.ps1
git commit -m "üêõ FIX: GitHub commit function name + Stock Intelligence email + PowerShell permissions"
git push
```

## Production Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. ‚úÖ GitHub commits appear in data/ticker_reference.csv
2. ‚úÖ Two emails received per ticker (Quick Intelligence + Stock Intelligence)
3. ‚úÖ Stock Intelligence email contains "üéØ Investment Thesis" section
4. ‚úÖ PowerShell script completes without permission errors
