# Google News URL Resolution Implementation - Session Summary
**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Production-Ready
**Success Rate**: 100% (12/12 Google News URLs resolved)

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

**Core Issue**: Google News RSS feeds provide redirect URLs (`news.google.com/rss/articles/...`) that cannot be scraped directly. When the scraper tried to extract content from these URLs, it received 0 characters, resulting in empty emails and no executive summaries.

**Impact**: ~50% of articles came from Google News feeds, all failing to scrape → 50% of content was lost.

---

## 🚀 The Solution: 3-Tier URL Resolution System

### Architecture Overview

```
Phase 1: Ingestion + Triage (0-60%)
├─ RSS feed discovery (Yahoo + Google News)
├─ AI triage (flags relevant articles)
└─ Email #1: Article Selection QA

Phase 1.5: Google News URL Resolution (62-64%) ⭐ NEW
├─ Tier 1: Advanced API (Google's internal API) - Free, fast
├─ Tier 2: Direct HTTP (redirect following) - Free, simple
└─ Tier 3: ScrapFly (ASP + JS rendering) - Paid, reliable ✅

Phase 3: Content Scraping (65-90%)
├─ Uses resolved URLs (not Google News URLs)
├─ 2-tier fallback: newspaper3k → ScrapFly
└─ Success rate: ~70% (vs 0% before)

Phase 4: Email #2 + Executive Summary (90-95%)
Phase 5: Email #3 + GitHub Commit (95-100%)
```

### Why Phase 1.5 Works

**Deferred Resolution Strategy**:
- Only resolves **flagged articles** (~20-30 per ticker)
- Runs AFTER triage, BEFORE scraping
- 80% fewer API calls vs resolving all 150+ articles
- No rate limiting issues (resolutions spread naturally)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. ScrapFly Resolution Function (Line 13137)

```python
async def resolve_google_news_url_with_scrapfly(url: str, ticker: str):
    """
    Uses ScrapFly with ASP + JS rendering to resolve Google News redirects

    Cost: ~$0.005-0.010 per URL
    Success rate: ~95-100%
    """
    params = {
        "key": SCRAPFLY_API_KEY,
        "url": url,
        "country": "us",
        "asp": "true",        # Anti-bot bypass
        "render_js": "true",  # JavaScript execution
    }

    response = await scrapfly.scrape(params)
    final_url = response.result.url  # Returns final URL after all redirects
    return final_url
```

**Key Features**:
- ASP (Anti-Scraping Protection) bypasses Google's anti-bot measures
- JS rendering handles client-side redirects
- Silent operation (no verbose logging)
- Graceful fallback (returns None on failure)

### 2. Resolution Chain (Line 13244)

```python
# Try Tier 1: Advanced API (free, fast)
resolved_url = google_advanced_api(url)

# Try Tier 2: Direct HTTP (free, simple)
if not resolved_url:
    resolved_url = requests.get(url, follow_redirects=True).url

# Try Tier 3: ScrapFly (paid, reliable)
if not resolved_url:
    resolved_url = await resolve_google_news_url_with_scrapfly(url, ticker)

# Update database
UPDATE articles SET resolved_url = %s, domain = %s WHERE id = %s
```

**Result Logging**:
```
[VST] ✅ [1/12] Tier 3 (ScrapFly) → americanactionforum.org
[VST] ✅ [2/12] Tier 3 (ScrapFly) → sharewise.com
...
[VST] 📊 Resolution Summary: ✅ Succeeded: 12 (100.0%)
```

### 3. Scraping Integration (Line 4470)

```python
async def scrape_single_article_async(article):
    # Use resolved URL when available, fall back to original
    url_to_scrape = article.get("resolved_url") or article.get("url")

    content = await scrape(url_to_scrape, domain)
    return content
```

### 4. Database Query Fix (Line 13313)

**Before** (Missing fields):
```sql
SELECT a.id, a.url, a.resolved_url, a.title
FROM articles a
```

**After** (Complete fields):
```sql
SELECT a.id, a.url, a.url_hash, a.resolved_url, a.title,
       a.description, a.domain, a.published_at
FROM articles a
```

### 5. Batch Processing Fix (Line 4416)

**Before** (Wrong operation):
```python
# Tried to INSERT articles that already exist
article_id = insert_article_if_new(url_hash, url, title, ...)
```

**After** (Correct operation):
```python
# Articles already exist, just use their IDs
article_id = article.get("id")
update_article_content(article_id, scraped_content, ...)
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Per Ticker Costs
- **Free Tier 1 & 2**: Attempt first, no cost
- **ScrapFly Tier 3**: ~12 URLs × $0.008 = **$0.096 per ticker**

### Monthly Costs (30 tickers/day)
- Daily: 30 tickers × $0.096 = **$2.88/day**
- Monthly: **$86.40/month**

### ROI
- **Before**: 0% content from Google News (50% of articles lost)
- **After**: 70% content from Google News (major improvement)
- **Value**: Recovered ~35% of total content pipeline

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Resolution Success Rate
- **Tier 1 (Advanced API)**: 0% (Google rate limits)
- **Tier 2 (Direct HTTP)**: 0% (Google doesn't redirect)
- **Tier 3 (ScrapFly)**: **100%** (12/12 succeeded) ✅

### End-to-End Pipeline
- **Phase 1.5**: 100% resolution success (12/12 URLs)
- **Phase 3**: ~70% scraping success (resolved URLs work!)
- **Phase 4**: 100% executive summary generation ✅
- **Phase 5**: 100% email delivery ✅

### Processing Time
- Resolution adds: **~5-10 seconds per ticker**
- Total ticker time: **~30 minutes** (unchanged)
- Concurrent processing: **4 tickers recommended**

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Wrong Architecture Order
**Problem**: Scraping happened BEFORE resolution
**Fix**: Added Phase 1.5 between ingestion and scraping
**Result**: Resolved URLs available when scraping starts

### Issue 2: Database Constraint Violations
**Problem**: Missing url_hash field caused NULL constraint errors
**Fix**: Added url_hash and published_at to query
**Result**: No more database errors

### Issue 3: Wrong Database Operations
**Problem**: Batch code tried to INSERT existing articles
**Fix**: Removed insert_article_if_new() calls, use article IDs directly
**Result**: Clean database updates

### Issue 4: Verbose Logging
**Problem**: 20+ log lines per URL resolution attempt
**Fix**: Removed verbose logging, only show successful tier
**Result**: Clean logs

### Issue 5: Unnecessary Database Column
**Problem**: Added source_url column for Yahoo chains
**Fix**: Removed source_url from UPDATE statement
**Result**: Simpler schema

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- **Deferred resolution**: Only resolve flagged articles (80% fewer calls)
- **ScrapFly ASP + JS**: Bypasses Google's anti-bot perfectly
- **Clean logging**: Only show tier that succeeded
- **Simple schema**: Removed unnecessary source_url column

### What Didn't Work
- **Google's internal API**: Rate limited (429) on every attempt
- **Direct HTTP**: Google doesn't redirect for bots
- **Resolving all articles**: Too many API calls, rate limiting issues
- **source_url tracking**: Unnecessary complexity

### Best Practices
- ✅ Test with 1 ticker first
- ✅ Use ScrapFly for Google (designed for this)
- ✅ Defer expensive operations until after filtering
- ✅ Keep database schema simple
- ✅ Remove verbose logging in production

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Caching**: Cache resolved URLs for 24 hours (save API calls)
2. **Batch resolution**: Group multiple URLs in single ScrapFly call
3. **Fallback to search**: Use Google Search site: operator as Tier 4
4. **Smart retry**: Retry Tier 1/2 after delay if Tier 3 fails

### Not Recommended
- ❌ Increasing concurrent tickers beyond 4 (rate limiting)
- ❌ Resolving all articles before triage (wasteful)
- ❌ Adding more database columns (KISS principle)
