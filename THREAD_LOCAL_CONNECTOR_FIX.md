# Thread-Local HTTP Connector Fix

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Issue:** "Event loop is closed" errors causing job failures with 3+ concurrent tickers
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## üî¥ The Problem

When processing 3+ tickers concurrently with `ThreadPoolExecutor`, jobs would fail with:

```
Event loop is closed
‚ùå ALL TIERS FAILED for [domain] - Free: Event loop is closed, Scrapfly: Event loop is closed
```

**What was happening:**

1. **Thread 1 (CRM)** starts first
   - `asyncio.run()` creates event loop A
   - First HTTP request binds global `_HTTP_CONNECTOR` to loop A
   - CRM finishes, loop A closes

2. **Thread 2 (DNN) & Thread 3 (INTC)** still running
   - Try to use HTTP for scraping/API calls
   - Global connector is still bound to **closed loop A**
   - All async operations fail with "Event loop is closed"

3. **Cascading Failure:**
   - Jobs hang waiting for async operations
   - Worker monitor detects freeze
   - Attempts restart, hits same bug
   - Render kills instance after 3 failed restarts

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

**Made `aiohttp.TCPConnector` thread-local instead of global.**

### Before (Broken):
```python
# ONE global connector shared by all threads
_HTTP_CONNECTOR = aiohttp.TCPConnector()

def _get_or_create_connector():
    global _HTTP_CONNECTOR
    if _HTTP_CONNECTOR is None:
        _HTTP_CONNECTOR = aiohttp.TCPConnector()  # Created once, bound to first loop
    return _HTTP_CONNECTOR
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# ONE connector per thread (stored in thread-local storage)
_thread_local = threading.local()

def _get_or_create_connector():
    if not hasattr(_thread_local, 'connector') or _thread_local.connector is None:
        _thread_local.connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector()  # Created once per thread
    return _thread_local.connector
```

---

## üìù Changes Made

### 1. **app.py (Lines 88-147)**

**Changed:**
- Moved `_HTTP_CONNECTOR` from global to thread-local storage
- Updated `_get_or_create_connector()` to use thread-local connector
- Updated `cleanup_http_session()` to also cleanup connector
- Added debug logging to track connector creation per thread

**Key Functions:**
- `_get_or_create_connector()` - Creates connector per thread
- `get_http_session()` - Uses thread's connector (unchanged logic)
- `cleanup_http_session()` - Closes session AND connector when job completes

### 2. **CLAUDE.md (Lines 770-787)**

**Added:**
- Documentation of the fix under "Parallel Ticker Processing"
- Explanation of root cause, solution, and trade-offs
- Scaling implications (3 connectors for 3 concurrent jobs, etc.)

## üé≠ Kitchen Analogy

**Before (Broken):**
- 3 chefs (threads) trying to share ONE oven (global connector)
- Oven gets wired to Chef 1's generator (event loop)
- Chef 1 finishes and takes generator
- Oven is now powerless for Chef 2 and Chef 3
- **Error:** "Event loop is closed"

**After (Fixed):**
- Each chef gets their OWN oven (thread-local connector)
- Chef 1's oven wired to their generator
- Chef 2's oven wired to their generator
- Chef 3's oven wired to their generator
- When Chef 1 leaves, only their oven stops working
- **Chefs 2 and 3 continue cooking with their own ovens**

## üìä Resource Impact

### HTTP Connections (External APIs: ScrapFly, OpenAI, Claude)

| Concurrency | Connectors | Max HTTP Connections | Impact |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|--------|
| 1 ticker | 1 | 100 | Baseline |
| 3 tickers | 3 | 300 (100 √ó 3) | ‚úÖ Fine - external APIs handle millions |
| 4 tickers | 4 | 400 (100 √ó 4) | ‚úÖ Fine - external APIs handle millions |

### Database Connections (PostgreSQL - YOUR Render DB)

| Concurrency | DB Connections | Limit | Headroom |
|-------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| 1 ticker | ~15 | 100 | ‚úÖ 85 free |
| 3 tickers | ~45 | 100 | ‚úÖ 55 free |
| 4 tickers | ~60 | 100 | ‚úÖ 40 free |
| 5 tickers | ~75 | 100 | ‚ö†Ô∏è 25 free (tight) |

**IMPORTANT:** HTTP connector changes DO NOT affect database connections (separate system).

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy to Render

The code is already updated. Just commit and push:

```bash
git add app.py CLAUDE.md THREAD_LOCAL_CONNECTOR_FIX.md
git commit -m "üîß FIX: Thread-local HTTP connectors to prevent 'Event loop is closed'"
git push
```

Render will auto-deploy.

### Step 2: Test with 3 Concurrent Tickers

Run a small test batch:

```python
# Via /admin/test or PowerShell
tickers = ["CRM", "DNN", "INTC"]  # 3 tickers
MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS = 3
```

**What to look for in logs:**

‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
```
üîå Created new HTTP connector for thread: TickerWorker-0
üîå Created new HTTP connector for thread: TickerWorker-1
üîå Created new HTTP connector for thread: TickerWorker-2
[CRM] ‚úÖ SCRAPFLY SUCCESS: domain.com -> 5432 chars
[DNN] ‚úÖ SCRAPFLY SUCCESS: domain.com -> 4321 chars
[INTC] ‚úÖ SCRAPFLY SUCCESS: domain.com -> 6543 chars
[CRM] üßπ Cleaned up HTTP session + connector for thread
```

‚ùå **Failure Indicators (should NOT see these):**
```
Event loop is closed
‚ùå ALL TIERS FAILED for [domain] - Event loop is closed
üö® Worker frozen! 3 jobs queued, no activity for 5.0 minutes
```

### Step 3: Test with 10 Concurrent Tickers (Production Simulation)

Once 3-ticker test passes, try a larger batch:

```python
tickers = ["CRM", "DNN", "INTC", "TSLA", "NVDA", "AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "META"]
MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS = 3  # Process 3 at a time
```

**Expected:**
- 3 tickers process concurrently
- 3 more start when first 3 complete
- Final 4 tickers process
- **Total time: ~100 minutes** (10 tickers √∑ 3 concurrent √ó 30 min)

### Step 4: Increase to 4 Concurrent (Recommended Production)

Set in Render environment variables:
```
MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=4
```

**Expected:**
- 4 connectors created (one per thread)
- **Total time: ~75 minutes** (10 tickers √∑ 4 concurrent √ó 30 min)
- Database connections: ~60/100 (safe margin)

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ What Should Work Now

1. **3+ concurrent tickers process successfully**
   - No "Event loop is closed" errors
   - All async operations (scraping, AI calls, URL resolution) work
   - Jobs complete normally with executive summaries

2. **Resource usage stays low**
   - CPU: ~40-60%
   - Memory: ~1200MB / 2048MB (4 concurrent)
   - DB Connections: ~60 / 100 (4 concurrent)

3. **Automatic scaling**
   - Set `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=3` ‚Üí 3 connectors
   - Set `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=4` ‚Üí 4 connectors
   - Set `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=5` ‚Üí 5 connectors

4. **Complete thread isolation**
   - One ticker crashing doesn't affect others
   - Clean separation of resources per thread

### ‚ùå What Should NOT Happen Anymore

1. "Event loop is closed" errors
2. Jobs hanging at scraping phase
3. Worker freeze ‚Üí restart ‚Üí crash loop
4. Empty executive summaries due to scraping failures
5. Render instance crashes during concurrent processing

## ü§î FAQ

### Q: Does this affect database connections?
**A:** No. HTTP connectors are for external API calls (ScrapFly, OpenAI, Claude). Database connections are managed separately by `psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool`.

### Q: Can I scale to 10 concurrent tickers?
**A:** Theoretically yes (10 connectors √ó 100 connections = 1000 HTTP connections to external APIs). But you'd hit database connection limits (~150/100). Stick to **MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=4** for optimal balance.

### Q: What's the performance trade-off?
**A:** You lose global connection pooling (one 100-connection pool vs multiple 100-connection pools). But since you're well within resource limits, this doesn't matter. The fix is stability over marginal efficiency.

### Q: Will this work with future Render deployments?
**A:** Yes! Thread-local storage is standard Python. Each rolling deployment starts fresh with clean thread-local storage.
